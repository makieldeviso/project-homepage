Responsive homepage project for Odin. 

1. This project is not an actual personal portfolio. This is made to demonstrate learnings under advanced HTML and CSS.

2. But the projects rendered in the page are real projects that I created for Odin. which you can view the code and live demo.

3. Contact links (Github, Linkedin and Facebook) all leads to my github page. Also the contact numbers and email are placeholders.
